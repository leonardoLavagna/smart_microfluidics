# smart_microfluidic
Implementation of a data-driven solution for smart [microfluidics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microfluidics) applications.

## What's in Here?

Here you can find the code associated to the project.
  - `developer's directories` are all the directories starting with an underscore such as `_models`, `_include` etc... They contain auxiliary materials that enable online deployment of the project. In particular:
      - `_models` contains different machine learning models (as pickle files) used for the data-driven application. These models have been extensively validated (wet-lab validation).
      - `_include` contains icons, badges, warning messages, auxiliary data, etc...
  - `data` contains the dataset we used for building and training the models.
  - `notebooks` contains the training steps of the machine learning models in `models` as well as all the necessary code to reproduce them.
  - `requirements.txt` contaions the list of requirements needed to run the code.
  - `smart_microfluidics.py` is the overall script that incorporates data visualization tools and the proposed models. This script is associated to the app: [smart-microfluidics.streamlit.app](https://smart-microfluidics.streamlit.app/).
  - `config.py` is a configuration file to set up paths needed in the streamlit app.
